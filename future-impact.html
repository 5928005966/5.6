        <h2>Artificial Intelligence: A Systems Approach</h2>
        <p>One way that AI can impact future jobs is by decreasing human labor, but increasing Artificial Intelligence labor productivity. With AI labor, it can allow for less human errors and it can learn and adapt in the work industry, without the help of people. Another way that AI can impact future jobs is by being able to not only replace peopleâ€™s jobs, but replace certain jobs that it can do better than people can.
